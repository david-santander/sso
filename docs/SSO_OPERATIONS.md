## 2. SecureSSO Application Onboarding Process

* **Source URL:** `https://otshare.nam.citi.net/sites/SSOEXT/Pages/SecureSSO_Application_Onboarding_Process.aspx`
* **Time in Video:** 0:16 - 0:34
* **Content:**
  * **What is Secure SSO?:** An identity and access management solution for web applications within Citi, providing SSO by integrating with PingFederate (OAuth2 Authorization Server) using OpenID Connect. Its main function is to protect an application or API.
  * **Instructions:**
        1. Report all onboarding issues via tickets: `https://otshare.nam.citi.net/sites/SSOEXT/pages/vt_reqs.aspx`
        2. Refer to SecureSSO agent supported matrix on PingAccess Agent Supported Platforms (CEDT Confluence DC - nsoot.net) before raising CMP.
        3. Client DEV, UAT, and PROD applications must be on the same platforms; deviations are not supported.
        4. If LDAP group/FID protection is needed, specify this in CMP. FID/LDAP group requests must precede SecureSSO integration requests. Group/FID names must be consistent across environments.
            *Corporate LDAP SSO - Create New Group (DEV/UAT): `https://marketplace.citigroup.net/product/39841_29362_GLOBAL`
            * Corporate LDAP SSO - Create New Group (PROD): `https://marketplace.citigroup.net/product/39841_38478_GLOBAL`
            * SSO Functional ID - Create ID: `https://marketplace.citigroup.net/product/47394_99782_GLOBAL`
        5. Correctly submitted Secure SSO CMP requests are approved within SLO. Fulfilled requests trigger an automated email with agent properties for webserver configuration.
        6. Non-compliant requests are rejected with automated notification.
        7. Maximum one application per CSI per environment per domain. Multiple URLs can be added via SecureSSO - Policy Modify.
        8. For applications with MFA critical functions (MFA-FFEC), MFA committee approval is mandatory before CMP creation. Contact "IS Global MFA Assessment Group" for guidance.
        9. SLO for all requests: `https://otshare.nam.citi.net/sites/SSOEXT/pages/SLO.aspx`
  * **Process by Environment (Development, UAT, PROD):**
    * **Development:**
            1. **Initiate Request:** Raise CMP for new SecureSSO Integration (Product - SecureSSO - Policy Create). Automated notification upon submission.
            2. **Configure Web-App Servers:** Use agent properties from automated email. Refer to PingAccess Agent Supported Platforms (CEDT Confluence DC) for guidance. Installation via CAS/Starfleet/Manual.
            3. **Perform Application Testing:** Application team tests in dev. Report SSO issues via ticket: `https://otshare.nam.citi.net/sites/SSOEXT/pages/vt_reqs.aspx`
            4. **Modification to DEV Setups:** Use CMP Product - Ping Access - Policy Modify.
    * **UAT:**
            1. **Promote Development to UAT:** Raise CMP (Product - SecureSSO - Policy Promote).
            2. **Configure Web-App Servers:** (Same as Development Step 2).
            3. **Perform Application Testing:** (Same as Development Step 3).
            4. **Modification to UAT Setups:** (Same as Development Step 4).
    * **PROD:**
            1. **Promote UAT to PROD:** Raise CMP (Product - SecureSSO - Policy Promote).
            2. **PROD Request Completion:** Approved within SLO during SSO GreenZone (considering Global Change Freeze). Automated email with agent properties upon fulfillment. Certain requests require application team checkout/logoff post-change, with email approval from owner/requestor.
            3. **Configure Web-App Servers:** (Same as Development Step 2).
            4. **PROD Application Checkout:** Application team must perform checkout. Designated tester must be online. SSO team won't perform change if tester is unavailable. Application support handles middleware/SA coordination for restarts. Report production checkout issues promptly for rollback during green zone.
            5. **Modification to PROD Setups:** (Same as Development Step 4).

            * IDP use case (Citi is IDP): Citi public cert provided to app team (download from `https://otshare.nam.citi.net/sites/SSOEXT/SitePages/PING%20Federation.aspx`). Vendor installs to verify assertion.
            *SP use case (Citi is SP): App team gets vendor's public cert, uploads in CMP. Citi business requestor manages certs, provides updates 100+ days before expiry. Assertion: min 5 min validity (300s).
            * Self-signed certs not allowed.
            *Onboard external CA certs (non-MSPI/Digicert) in SSL Tracker via CitiMarketplace (SSL Certificate Tracker - Other type certificates ONLY).

        6. **Proceed to Production Request.**
  * **STEPS FOR PRODUCTION SETUP:**
        1. **Promote UAT to PROD:** Raise CMP (same link as Dev Step 1).

    * **SEV 1 (Major outage):** Response ASAP, work until SEV 2 state/repair.
    * **SEV 2 (Service impacted):** Response at earliest (after SEV 1s), work until SEV 3 state/repair.
    * **SEV 3 (Dev/UAT, etc.):** Actioned after SEV 1/2s addressed.
  * **Order of Priority:**
        1. Prod Env Outage (Immediate).
        2. Prod App down/service impact (Immediate).
        3. App in Prod, GO LIVE affected (ASAP).
        4. UAT SSO infra down.
        5. DEV SSO infra down.
        6. Dev/UAT Issues (Up to 10 business days). Auth Services works on tickets per order in CTI GL EX SECOPS SSO A queue. Resolve within 10 biz days (delays possible).
  * Tickets via `.../vt_reqs.aspx` process are subject to SLO.
  * **Please Note:**
        1. SLO clock starts after ticket reaches Auth Services queue (Triage/Dispatch) with all info.
        2. No email responses. Creator works with assignee via SN, sets up calls.
        3. Auth Services supports 2000+ apps globally, team in shifts, no dedicated support per app/project. Work based on Auth Services SLO.
  * **Siteminder / LDAP / Citi Federation / SecureSSO (CMP Automation / Manual):**
    * Dev/UAT: 5 biz days; Prod: 6 biz days per request (1 request per env/CMP).
  * **Citi Federation UAT Analysis CMP Requests:**
    * 2 biz days for approval (if CMP has all info).
    * 6 biz days post-approval for UAT analysis & update in Resolve IT.
  * **SSO Changes:** First come, first serve.
  * Prioritization for PROD (cannot wait for SLO): Refer to Business Critical Process.
  * Freeze period not in SLO. Prod changes during freeze must follow documented Business Critical Process.
  * Do not raise same request in all envs simultaneously (will be rejected). Complete Dev before UAT, UAT before Prod.

* **Source URL:** `https://otshare.nam.citi.net/sites/SSOEXT/Pages/sso_va_issues.aspx`
* **Time in Video:** 3:26 - 3:38
* **Content:**
  * Reference: CATE SSO Engineering Site - SiteMinder VA Finding Remediation Guidance/Best Practices.
  * **SSO VA Issues (Table):** Lists Citigroup Ref # (e.g., CVA 0088) and Vulnerability Subject (mostly "Siteminder Issue").
    * Examples: CVA 0088 (URL Redirection upon authentication), CVA 0092 (XSS), CVA 0140 (Hidden Fields Credentials encoded Base64).
  * **Issues Details (Expands on click):**
    * **Example CVA 0088 (URL Redirection upon authentication - Siteminder Issue):**
      * **Vulnerability Category:** Input Validation/URL Redirection.
      * **Explanation:** Target parameter in `https://www.anycity.com/login.fcc` not validated backend, can be modified to redirect to arbitrary sites. Attacker can use for phishing. Sample POST request shows redirection to google.com. Backend must validate redirection parameter.
      * **Recommended Solutions:** Siteminder Rec: Redirection Upon Authentication. Agent Version >= 6qmr5 cr36 / 6.0.5.16. Policy Server >= 6.0sp5CR6.
      * **Required ACO settings:** `Validtargetdomain=<names>`, `targetasrelativeuri=YES`. For cookie provider, configure with `validtargetdomains`. `BadUrlChars=// \`. Use FCC password services.
      * **VA KB Link:** `https://archer01.citigroup.net/archer/...kbid=94855`
      * **SSO Operational Recommendations:** Request policy changes via siteminder tool: `https://webiso4.nj.ssmb.com/sitemgister/`. Takes 2 weeks. Webbank-hosted: contact CRM.
