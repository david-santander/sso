## 1. Executive Summary

### 1.1 Purpose
This Business Requirements Document outlines the implementation of a comprehensive Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) system for the Single Sign-On (SSO) Proof of Concept (POC) project. The RBAC system will provide secure, scalable, and manageable access control across both SAML and OIDC authentication protocols.

### 1.2 Background
The current SSO POC system has partially implemented role-based access control, with the OIDC application supporting roles while the SAML application lacks this functionality. This inconsistency creates security vulnerabilities and limits the system's ability to enforce proper access controls across different authentication methods.

### 1.3 Solution Overview
Implement a unified RBAC system that:
- Provides consistent role enforcement across SAML and OIDC applications
- Implements frontend and backend authorization controls
- Establishes role hierarchies and permission management
- Ensures compliance with security standards
- Enables audit logging and monitoring

---

## 2. Business Objectives

### 2.1 Primary Objectives
1. **Security Enhancement**: Implement robust access controls to protect sensitive resources
2. **Compliance**: Meet regulatory requirements for access control and audit trails
3. **Operational Efficiency**: Streamline user access management and reduce administrative overhead
4. **User Experience**: Provide seamless, role-appropriate access to applications
5. **Scalability**: Create a system that can accommodate organizational growth

### 2.2 Strategic Alignment
- Aligns with Citibanamex's digital transformation initiatives
- Supports zero-trust security architecture principles
- Enables future integration with enterprise systems
- Facilitates regulatory compliance (SOX, PCI-DSS, etc.)
